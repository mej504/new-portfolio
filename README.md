# 2021 Portfolio Site

This is my updated portfolio site for 2021. With a fresh feel and more modern look, this portfolio site better reflects both my personality and skills as a web developer.

## Goals with this project

I had two main goals at the onset of building this site:

1. Better reflect my web-development chops than I accomplished in my previous portfolio site
2. Learn Next.js

## Long-term goals

While I'm always looking to take on new projects and revisit old, I very much am satisfied with the outcome of this project. Aside from optimizations and minor design changes, I can't imagine undertaking any major design changes.

## Todos

[ ] Harden responsiveness of work page

[✔] Fix issue where skill cards can restart animation (only once) when a user scrolls up and back down mid-animation

[✔] Resolve issue where background video doesn't swap on portrait -> landscape

	▶ Fixed by picking a new background video =D

[✔] Adjust work cards on landing page for mobile users (they feel too big)

[✔] Adjust size of skills cards for mobile users (again, they feel too big)

[✔]Improve notification rendering when user sends a message

[✔] Ensure images attached to project cards aren't clipping in bad spots

[In progress] Replace all images with Next's `<Image>` component

[✔] Adjust design/layout of project cards for mobile users ( ... too big )
