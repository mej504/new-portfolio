# 2021 Portfolio Site

This is my updated portfolio site for 2021. With a fresh feel and more modern look, this portfolio site better reflects both my personality and skills as a web developer.

---

## Goals with this project

I had two main goals at the onset of building this site:

1. Better reflect my web-development chops than I accomplished in my previous portfolio site
2. Learn Next.js

## Long-term goals

While I'm always looking to take on new projects and revisit old, I very much am satisfied with the outcome of this project. Aside from optimizations and minor design changes, I can't imagine undertaking any major design changes.

## Todos

[ ] Harden responsiveness of work page

[ ] Resolve issue where background video doesn't swap on portrait -> landscape

	▶ Failing to do so creates mostly-empty background

[ ] Adjust work cards on landing page for mobile users (they feel too big)

[ ] Adjust size of skills cards for mobile users (again, they feel too big)

[ ] Improve notification rendering when user sends a message

[ ] Ensure images attached to project cards aren't clipping in bad spots

[ ] Replace all images with Next's `<Image>` component

	▶ Due to lack of experience with Next, I encountered frequent issues aligning the component's functionality with my design goals

[ ] Adjust design/layout of project cards for mobile users ( ... too big )
